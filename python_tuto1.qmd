## Setup

::: r-fit-text
Setting up a local python environment is a pain...

:::

## Setup

Easiest way : install Anaconda Navigator...

Editors: - IDLE = default - Anaconda \> Spyder, PyCharm, ... and RStudio too! File \> New file \> Python script

![Python prompt: \>\>\>](img/py_in_RStudio.png){height="50%"}

## Setup

Online options:

-   **Jupyter notebooks:** open from Anaconda

-   **google colab :** (+) has google installed libraries and GPU/TPU power (limited GO). (-) to make one you need a google account

## Basics

Same programming rules:

-   named variables:

`>>> a=50` - use `+=` to increment/concatenate

`>>> a += a + 1`

-   a list = multiple values in a variable. Each value is identified by its **key** (name).

`>>> mylist = ['tic', 'tac', 'toc']`

-   in Python, index starts at 0, not 1 (so NOT like in R): in mylist, the key for value toto is 0.

`>>> print(mylist[2])`

## Basics

A common object to manipulate in Python are **dictionaries**: they're a pair of KEY:Value just like in lists, but here keys in dictionaries aren't ordered. Use `{}` to initiate them (but still use `[]` to manipulate them).

`>>> mydico = {}` or

`>>> mydico = dict(Lastname = "Petit", Firstname = "Cathleen", Pronounciation = "Kétline")`

Same conditional rules as in R: if, else, elsif... --\> NO !! it's **elif** (but who uses those..?!)

**Arithmetic operators :** the usual, but also: `%`, which means 'modulo', is a multiple of. Returns 1 or 0 (True/False).

**Logical operators :** `==, !=, >, >=, ...`


### For loops:

Synthax:
:::

::: {style="font-size: 100%;"}
``` python
string = 'Hello sunshine !'
for a in string :
  print (a)
```

Try it !

## A few commun built-in functions:

::: {style="font-size: 55%;"}
`random(list)` → choose random element of a list

`len(list)` → number of elements in list

`max / min(list)`

`str.split(separator)` → transform str into list according to separator

`list.append(value)` → add a value to list (like c() in R)

`del list[key]`, **NOT the same as** `list.remove(value)`

`list.count(value)` → counts number of occurrences of that value in the list

`list[-1]` → shows the last value of the list

`list[a:b]` → show values from a to b

`x.extend(y`)\` → concatenate lists x and y

`str.find(string)` → counts occurrences of str in string

`str.replace(where, what)`

`input(string)` → prints string and asks user for feedback (VERY INTERESTING)

`range(int)` → useful in for loops: for i in range(1, 10):

## Libraries

Just like in R: built-in functions, but also packages of functions, called libraries.

Use `import library` to load them. Colab has many pre-installed libraries, but sometimes you need to activate them at the beginning of your session with `!pip install library` or `pip install library` or `pip3 install library` if you're using a local environment.

### Common libraries:

-   math, random, numpy, ...

-   scikit-learn, pytorch, SciPy, TensorFlow, Keras....: `import sklearn as skl` → data science.

-   matplotlib : data viz. You can also choose to only import a function instead of the whole library: `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`

-   pandas : Python's tidyverse ;) Handles dataframes.

## Your turn !!

-   play around with the different functions

### Exercise:

Write a script to ask the user their age, and give different answers depending on whether you think it's old or young.

## Answer:

``` python
limit = 99

age = input("How old are you ?")

if int(age) > limit:
  print("Wow, you're a living fossil !")
else:
  print("Oh yeah, you're alright.")
```

## Take home :

-   indents !

-   ":" after ifs and elses, rather than brackets like in R

-   code execution by individual cells (on Colab/Jupyter) or entire script (Spyder, etc).

-   python errors are usually quite precise: **read the error messages carefully**. Otherwise, absolute rule is: the internet has looooaaads of python forums, help pages, tutorials, bug fixes. A very active community.

## Homework :)

Generate a list of integers, and then show:

- the list

- the list in column format, displaying matching keys and values

- the sum of all elements of the list

- create a new list made of 5 multiples of the original list

- give min and max values of the list

- count occurrences of pair and odd numbers and sum them


## Quick games

Write a program to...

- throw a dice

- throw 2 dice

- Rock paper cisors

- guess a number between 1 and 1000 by indicating when the value is higher or lower

- hangman (without the graphical aspect)
